# Using Data Science to Understand Data Science: A Canada-U.S. Comparison of the Labour Market

This is my final capstone project to earn the IBM Professional Data Science Certificate.

In this project, I analyze and compare the data science labour market in Canada and the United States.

Data visualization products created:
* categorical plots (seaborn)
* box plots (seaborn)
* histograms (seaborn)
* heatmap (dython)
* line plot (matplotlib)

Machine learning algorithms modelled:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Support Vector Machine
* K-Nearest Neighbour
